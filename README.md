eBusiness Shop – UWE Coursework Project

Overview

This project is a functional e-commerce web application developed as part of my university coursework for the eBusiness module at UWE. The shop simulates a real-world online retail experience, enabling users to browse items, add them to a cart, and complete purchases through a basic checkout process.

The system demonstrates key e-business concepts including product management, user interaction, basic order processing, and session handling. It also incorporates aspects of digital commerce theory covered in the module, such as usability, data security, and online consumer behaviour.

Features
	•	User Interface: Clean, responsive design for browsing items
	•	Cart System: Add/remove items, view running totals
	•	Checkout Process: Simulated order submission with basic validation
	•	Product Management: Items displayed from a backend database
	•	Session Management: Persistent cart using PHP session storage

Tools & Technologies
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Backend: PHP
	•	Database: MySQL (XAMPP or phpMyAdmin for testing)
	•	Version Control: Git
	•	IDE: Visual Studio Code

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository or download the source files
	2.	Set up a local server (e.g., XAMPP or MAMP)
	3.	Import the provided SQL file into phpMyAdmin
	4.	Place the project folder in the /htdocs directory
	5.	Run localhost/[project-folder] in your browser

Learning Outcomes
	•	Applied understanding of e-commerce architecture

	•	Developed front-to-back full stack integration
	•	Demonstrated theoretical concepts (e.g., checkout UX, trust elements, and security basics) in a working system
